Current version of my resume. Downloadable as either PDF or LaTeX.

Thanks to Michael DeCorte for making the style template available. He
owns the copyright on the style (res.cls).

I claim the copyright on _my_ resume. Feel free to use this as a
starting point for your own LaTeX-based resume. If you use this,
please change all of the relevant specifics. I'd rather not meet my
resume-clone someday.
