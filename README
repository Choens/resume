You have found the resume repository for Andrew Choens (Andy).

Although I GPL most of what I create, I chose the Artistic License for
my resume. You are welcome to use my resume as a guide to using
Michael DeCorte's res.cls document class, but it is my resume.

Thankyou to Michael DeCorte for making the document class
available. He owns the copyright on the res.cls file. The
Artistic License I claim on the .tex and .pdf files do NOT apply to
his res.cls file.
