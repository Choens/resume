# Andy's Resume

You have found the resume repository for Andrew Choens (Andy).

My resume is licensed under the Artistic License. You are welcome to
use my resume as a guide to using Michael DeCorte's res.cls document
class. 

Thank you to Michael DeCorte for making the document class
available. He owns the copyright on the res.cls file. The
Artistic License I claim on the .tex and .pdf files do NOT apply to
his resume class.

The folder, cover-letters, contains active and some inactive cover
letters I have written. I keep these to document where I've applied
recently, and what I have said. And, frankly, to make it easier to
write the next one.
