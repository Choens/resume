    management program for enrollees with highly complex health care
    needs. Health Home enrollees have a history of high utilization of
    emergency, high-cost services. Health Homes provide continuous,
    integrated health care services to improve participant’s health
    and well-being while reducing unnecessary utilization of inpatient
    and emergency department services.
