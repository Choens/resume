    I teach two undergraduate data classes. These classes teach practical

      language. The class builds on the knowledge gained in their statistics
      course and introduces core R programming skills such as data management,
      data clean up, single table data transformations as well as linear and
      logistic regression.
      \item[2.] Applied Public Health Data with R builds on the previous course. This course introduces basic relational data modeling, more complex data management and introduces students to some basic machine learning such as decision trees and random forests.

    The New York State Technology Enterprise Corporation is a technology

    state governments, as well as local government agencies in New England.

    I provide support services for the Medicaid System Innovation (MSI) team
    which provides services for New York State Medicaid program. In addition to
    providing direct analytical and workflow services to the client, I help the
    MSI team improve internal processes and outcomes. I also mentor junior staff
    and provide support on new services which existing staff may not have
    experience with such as NLP, machine learning, and AI.

    Data sources include NYS Medicaid, NYS Uniform Assessment System (UAS), and
    in-house data sets.

  \location{Remote, USA}
  \begin{position}
    Charlie Health is a mental health provider which delivers
    remote-first Intensive Outpatient Care (IOC) to youth and young adults. 
    
    I supervised the nascent data engineering team. We supported business
    operations by improving and democratizing access to Charlie Health's data.
    We implemented a process to slowly transition the operations team from a
    workflow driven by Google Sheets, to a more automated data flow using
    Snowflake and BI tools such as Tableau. By providing automated access to the
    data and reporting, we gave the operations team the time they needed to
    actually lead the operation of the company.

  %% Acuitas -------------------------------------------------------------------
  \employer{\href{http://www.acuitashealth.com/}{Acuitas Health}}
  \title{Data Science and Engineering Leader}
  \dates{September 2017 - June 2022}
  \location{Troy, NY}
  \begin{position}
    Acuitas was a population health services organization which helped primary
    care providers succeed in value based contracts with health insurance
    companies. As the leader of the Department of Data Science and Engineering I
    lead the implementation of data-driven services and products. The team I led:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item developed a set of process and procedures for the development of high
    quality, validated, data deliverables including reports and statistical models
    \item hired a diverse team of analysts and data scientists
    \item trained the team in our process and procedures
    \item implemented modern technologies such as Posit Connect to provide
    consistent, reproducle results across a diverse range of data products
    \end{itemize}

    During my time with Acuitas, we integrated dozens of EHR systems into a
    vendor neutral EHR and payer format which enabled us to provide data
    products to clients regardless of their internal tech stack.
    
    Notable data products provided include:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Federal HEDIS reports and tooling to identify opportunities to
      improve HEDIS scores
      \item Models and reports to accurately assess patient HCC scores
      \item Tools to monitor provider efficiency
      \item Models to identify high-risk patients such as patients at risk of
      falling
    \end{itemize}
  \end{position}

  Although I am proud of all the accomplishments listed above. The
  accomplishment I am most proud of was the culture of the team. The time/cost
  pressures placed on the Acuitas team is immense. Yet we were able to develop
  a culture of teamwork and trust which helped us support each other through a
  pandemic and successfully hit difficult timelines inside a broader climate
  which was not always supportive of what we were doing.

  %% PCG SSO -------------------------------------------------------------------

  \title{Healthcare Program Advisor}
  \dates{July 2017 - August 2017}
  \location{Albany, NY}
  \begin{position}
    This change in employer and job title are misleading. I moved from IPRO to
    PCG after PCG won the contract renewal. The state then instructed PCG to
    hire most of the IPRO staffers working on the contract to maintain
    continuity. I continued to report to the same DOH staff person and had the
    same responsibilities until I left in August.
  \end{position}

    evaluators and internal stakeholders to understand the impact and
    effectiveness of care management programs and how to improve them.

    Responsibilities include care management programs administered by
    the Medicaid Managed Care Plans and Health Homes. Care management
    programs are an administrative (case management) intervention for
    people with complex health care needs and high utilization of
    emergency and inpatient services. Care management programs provide
    integrated, supportive, and preventative health care services
    intended to improve participants' health and well-being while
    reducing the unnecessary utilization of inpatient and emergency
    department services.

    Accomplishments:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Monitor Emergency Department, Inpatient, and Primary Care
      utilization of Medicaid enrollees who agreed to receive care
      management services. Includes program improvement and pre-post
      analyses.
    \item Supervise the development and reporting of HEDIS quality
      metrics as listed in New York State's SPA to State Agency

    As a policy analyst, I was responsible for developing research hypotheses
    and methodologies and providing support and mentoring to junior staff. Other
